# 🚀 Aditya's Project Showcase

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This space is where I build, break, and learn through hands-on **mini-projects** and **real-world scenarios** 💻⚙️. From version control to containerized deployments — it’s all here!

## 🧩 What's Inside?

✨ **Practical Projects** based on real-life use cases  
🔁 **Version Control** with Git (branching, merging, reverting, etc.)  
🐳 **Dockerized Apps** running on isolated containers  
🌐 **Web Applications** hosted locally or on the cloud  
🔍 **Debugging Logs** and learning notes from each step
